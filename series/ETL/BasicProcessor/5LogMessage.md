### 1. **What is LogMessage?**
1. **This processor is help us to `customize log`, we can set `info`,`warn` and `error` log information**
   </br>
2. **We also can use NIFI original and customer attributes in our log**
    </br>
3. But between **`LogAttribute**` and **`LogMessage**`? I would definitely recommend **`LogMessage**`. It gives you way more flexibility and makes your logs much clearer and easier to read.
