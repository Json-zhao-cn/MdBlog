Hey everyone, good night! Welcome back to Json’s class on mastering Apache NIFI—from zero to one.

In the last lesson, we went over some frequently used NIFI processors. 
We covered processor UpdateAttribute and how to use LogAttribute and LogMessage to record your customized log.
Today, we are going to keep exploring more useful processors. 
If you want more details, feel free to check out the official docs or just shoot me an email.

Here is what we are covering today:
1.	Using ExecuteSQL processor to query database data.
2.	Using ExecuteSQLRecord processor to query database data.
3.	Using ConvertRecord processor to convert ExecuteSQL results in what format data we want.

Alright, let’s get started!

First up: ExecuteSQL. This processor is SQL Query processor. You can use it to get the Database data. The result format is avro format.

Let us move on to the ExecuteSQLRecord. It is also the SQL Query processor. The result format is Json format.


That is a quick overview of ExecuteSQL and ExecuteSQLRecord. However, we cannot use the ExecuteSQL result directly due to the avro format data. 
So, we need to use ConvertRecord processor to convert the avro data to the Json format data.
Because the ExecuteSQLRecord result is Json format data, we don’t need to convert it again.
We need to add the controller service to the ConvertRecord. And enable it.

Cool, so now you know how to use ExecuteSQL and ExecuteSQLRecord to query database data whatever DB data you need. 
But between ExecuteSQL and ExecuteSQLRecord? I would definitely recommend ExecuteSQLRecord. Because the ExecuteSQLRecord result is Json format data.
You don’t need to convert it to Json again. 

And that is it for today! Next time, I will show you how to Split the Json data and evaluate the Json path. See you then!
