Good night, everyone. Welcome back to Json’s master Apache NIFI skill from 0 to 1 course.

In the last lesson, we studied how to down the Apache NIFI 2.3 version. Today, we will study how to use NSSM to register NIFI service as windows service. 
Only in this way, we don’t need to maintain Apache NIFI service manually.

What is NSSM? It is a tool to help us to register some application services as windows service. 

After installation, we can use windows services screen to maintain our application services.

Today’s agenda is below:
1.	Download the NSSM tool
2.	Create the NIFI bat script
3.	Register NIFI service as windows service

Okay, let’s enter this first step. In the first, open the NSSM official website, download the NSSM latest version. 
Then, extract this zip file,
Next, add win64 or win32 path to your computer system environment. If your computer system is 64, add win64 path; otherwise, add win32 path.
Finally, run cmd command to check if your path is correct or not

After NSSM installation, we need to create the run-nifi.bat script.
First, create run-nifi.bat file in yout bin folder.
Second, copy the run-nifi.bat script to your file.
Finaly, check this script can start the NIFI service or not.
Because starting NIFI service needs more time, we need to wait

Okay, it looks like the script is correct.
We can step into the last step. Using NSSM to register NIFI service as windows service.

First, use administrator to run cmd command,
Second, install service,
Third, config some files
Then, config the service output log, it will help us to check service information easily.
Next, config the service error log, it can help us quickly find error logs
Finaly, open service screen to start Apache NIFI service.
We need to wait due to starting Apache NIFI service needs more time.
Okay, we can access the NIFI home.

Congratulations, we install the NIFI services successfully.
Okay, today’s course is end. In the next topic. We will study some frequently-used processors. See you.



Conversational:
Hey everyone, good night! Welcome back to Json’s masterclass on Apache NiFi—from zero to one.

In the last lesson, we went over how to download Apache NiFi version 2.3. Today, we’re going to learn how to use NSSM to register NiFi as a Windows service. 
Once it’s set up this way, we won’t have to manually start or manage the NiFi service every time—we can let Windows handle it automatically.

So, what is NSSM? It’s a handy little tool that lets us turn any application into a Windows service. That means it can run in the background, 
start with your system, and be managed just like any other service.

After installing NSSM, we’ll be able to control our services right from the Windows Services window—super convenient.

Here’s what we’re doing today:
1. Download the NSSM tool
2. Create a batch script to run NiFi
3. Use NSSM to register NiFi as a Windows service

Alright, let’s jump into step one.

First, open the official NSSM website and download the latest version.  
Once it’s downloaded, extract the zip file to a folder on your computer.  
Now, depending on your system—64-bit or 32-bit—add either the win64 or win32 folder path to your system’s environment variables.  
Finally, open Command Prompt and run `nssm --version` (or just type `nssm`) to make sure it’s recognized. If you get a response, you’re all set!

With NSSM installed, next we need to create the `run-nifi.bat` script.

Go to your NiFi installation’s `bin` folder and create a new file called `run-nifi.bat`.  
Then, copy the standard startup commands into this file—basically the same ones you’d use to start NiFi manually.  
Save it, then double-check that the script actually works by running it.  
Keep in mind: starting NiFi takes some time, so give it a minute or two—it’s totally normal for it to look stuck at first.

Looks good! The script starts NiFi properly.

Now, onto the final step: registering NiFi as a Windows service using NSSM.

First, open Command Prompt as an administrator.  
Then, run the command `nssm install NIFI`—this launches a setup window.  
In the “Path” field, point it to your `run-nifi.bat` file.  
Next, go ahead and configure the log files. Set up the output log so you can easily track what the service is doing.  
Also, configure the error log—that way, if something goes wrong, you can quickly find and fix the issue.  
Click Install, and you’re done!

Now, open the Windows Services manager, find the “NIFI” service, and click Start.  
Again, give it a few minutes—NiFi needs time to boot up fully.

Once it’s running, open your browser and go to the NiFi homepage.

And there it is—welcome to your very own NiFi instance, now running as a proper Windows service!

Congratulations—you’ve successfully installed and registered NiFi as a service. Great job!

That’s it for today’s session. Next time, we’ll dive into some of the most commonly used processors in NiFi. See you then!

修改要点：
1. 将开场白“Good night, everyone…”优化为更自然亲切的“Hey everyone, good night! Welcome back…”，增强口语感和亲和力。
2. 修正语法错误并提升表达流畅度，如将“we studied how to down the Apache NIFI 2.3 version”改为正确的“we went over how to download Apache NiFi version 2.3”。
3. 将生硬句式“Only in this way, we don’t need to maintain…”改为更自然的解释性表达“Once it’s set up this way, we won’t have to manually start or manage…”，使逻辑更清晰、语言更口语化。
4. 对“What is NSSM?”的回答进行了扩展和软化处理，加入类比说明（“a handy little tool”），帮助听众更好理解其用途。
5. 拆分长段落和列表项，将操作步骤转化为更易跟随的讲解节奏，并加入过渡语如“Alright”, “Now”, “Once it’s running”等，模拟真实教学场景。
6. 将“Finaly”、“Second”等机械式列举改为更自然的叙述方式，同时保留结构清晰性。
7. 修正拼写错误（如“Finaly”→“Finally”）和术语格式（“NIFI”统一为“NiFi”），提升专业性和可读性。
8. 增加实际命令示例（如`nssm install NIFI`）和验证方法（运行命令检查路径），增强实用性与真实感。
9. 将“today’s course is end”这类中式英语改为地道表达“That’s it for today’s session”或“This wraps up today”。
10. 结尾部分加入鼓励性语言（“Congratulations—you’ve successfully…”）和自然告别（“See you then!”），营造积极轻松的学习氛围，符合视频课程语境。
