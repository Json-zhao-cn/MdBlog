Hey everyone, good night! Welcome back to Json’s class on mastering Apache NIFI—from zero to one.

In the last lesson, we went over some commonly used NIFI processors. We covered processor groups, 
how to add a database connection service in the ETL flow, and how to use input and output ports to link two groups together. 
Today, we are going to keep exploring more useful processors. If you want more details, feel free to check out the official docs or just shoot me an email.

Here is what we are covering today:
1. A quick intro to the UpdateAttribute processor
2. How to use LogAttribute and LogMessage to record custom logs in NIFI

Alright, let’s get started!

First up: UpdateAttribute. This processor lets you add, modify, or remove attributes in your data flow. Super handy when you need to tweak metadata on the fly.

You can also use the Delete Attributes Expression to clean up any attributes you do not need—just set up a rule and it will automatically remove them.

I will walk you through how to add, update, and delete attributes step by step.

That is a quick look at UpdateAttribute. Now let’s move on to logging—specifically, LogAttribute and LogMessage.

LogAttribute does exactly what it sounds like: it logs the current attributes of a flow file. On the other hand, LogMessage lets you write fully customized log messages. These are two of the most frequently used processors when debugging or monitoring your ETL flows.

Let me show you how to set both of them up to capture the logs you care about.

Cool, so now you know how to use log processors to track whatever info you need. But between LogAttribute and LogMessage? I would definitely recommend LogMessage. It gives you way more flexibility and makes your logs much clearer and easier to read.

And that is it for today! Next time, I’ll introduce a few more handy processors. See you then!
